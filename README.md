# grimBot
Custom Discord Bot named grim::
He's my boy. I have a server with my friends and usefulgrim is for when I actually need him to do something. jokegrim is for when I'm just messing around, so here's both. Soon to be part of a massive botsquad (no you don't get my token). He currently has many different functions and some specific to a single user. Just set up a grim.ini file. (I'll leave a blank copy you can use)
